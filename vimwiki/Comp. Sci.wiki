4-step engineering problem solving approach:
1. Understand the problem
2. Plan a solution
3. Carry out that plan
4. Examine your results for accuracy

    What most people don't understand is that most of the significant effort goes
    into the first two parts of the process. If you fail either of those, it hardly
    matters whether you've carried out your plan perfectly or accurately. So if you
    want to think like an engineer, solve your problems fully BEFORE diving into the
    implementation of your solution.
