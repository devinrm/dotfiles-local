# How do I get the code to tell a story, exactly?

* Assemble your solution from small, single-purpose functions that have no side effects.

* Aim for a simple, clear flow of data from small function to small function.

* Think in terms of inputs and outputs at every level of your system. Each small function transforms its input into an output.

* Use precise, self-describing names for your functions and variables.

* Functions in particular should be named "verbObject", like renderList or calculateAverage. This emphasizes the transformation of input into output.
