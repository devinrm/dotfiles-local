Increase PR open app time; if there's a QA backlog apps get closed down and then
when QA does get to them the app isn't there

Have different point people (like we do with bugs investigator) so one person isn't context switching all the time
(a clever person, an ops person, etc) and once it's working well consider
rotating roles every few sprints or whatever
